# Excel-Challenge

#### Given provided by the data, we can conclude that majority of the crowd funding was provided to theater projects, in which approximately 35% of projects had failed and 60% of them had succeeded.
  
#### Of all parent categories of the Kickstarter project, “Plays” had taken vast majority that received most of crowd funding, although the number of succeeding projects had decreased over time.
  
#### The dataset provides statistical data of monthly succeeding and failing projects, determining by the amount of crowd funds provided. The dataset, however, does not indicate any succeeding factors in Kickstarter projects, since it only shows statistical evidence of which projects may be more preferred, well-funded, or whether successful or not. There is a limitation to appeal our statistical evidence in showing which factors are succeeding factors in Kickstarter projects.
	
#### To provide better suggestions to determining the succeeding factors, we can add a graph to show the correlation between the time left for projects and the number of successful projects. Current data only shows the outside influence to the project’s success or failure. With the new table about the remaining time until the deadline, we can scrutinize into internal influences to the project; thereby we can acquire more possible evidence.
